# Claude Code Instructions

This repository builds **nr-workbench**, a Python package that scaffolds
neutron reflectometry analysis projects for SNS REF_L (BL-4B). It follows the
shared AI-assisted development workflow defined below.

@.github/copilot-instructions.md

## Claude-Specific Notes

The instructions above were written for GitHub Copilot but apply equally here.
Where they say "Copilot", read "the AI assistant".

### What this package is

`nrw init` writes a project skeleton into a user's directory. Two consequences
shape almost every decision:

1. **Everything under `src/nr_workbench/templates/` and
   `src/nr_workbench/skills/` is data that must reach the wheel.** It has no
   `__init__.py`, so `packages.find` will not carry it — only the
   `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` globs will. Those globs do *not* match
   dotfiles by default; see `docs/ground_truths.md`. If you add a template,
   `tests/test_packaging.py` will tell you whether it ships.
2. **`nrw init` runs on top of live working directories.** It must never
   overwrite a file the user has edited. The three-way logic lives in
   `project/scaffold.py` and is the most safety-critical code here.

### Read the plan

`~/.claude/plans/read-project-md-and-make-imperative-prism.md` holds the
approved milestone plan (M0 scaffold+skills → M1 provenance → M2 tNR assessment
→ M3 spec+generator → M4 forms → M5 web UI). `docs/project.md` is the original
requirement.

### Skills

Shared standards live once in [`skills/`](skills/) at the repo root — the
review standards (`review-*`) and authoring references (`python-*`) from
`ai-project-template`. The reviewer subagents in [`.claude/agents/`](.claude/agents/)
are thin dispatchers that load them.

`src/nr_workbench/skills/` is different: those are the **reflectometry domain
skills we ship to users**, not standards for this repo. They follow the
neutron-skills v2 anatomy (Overview / When to Use / Process / Rationalizations
/ Red Flags / Verification), and `tests/test_skills.py` enforces it.

### Working with AuRE

Every `aure` import must be function-local and must live in
`src/nr_workbench/aure_adapter.py`. Importing it costs 1.5-3 seconds and pulls
the whole LLM stack; `tests/test_cli.py` fails if `nrw --help` touches it.
AuRE also declares no stable API, so the adapter is the one place a signature
change has to be fixed. See `docs/ground_truths.md`.

### Ground truths

[`docs/ground_truths.md`](docs/ground_truths.md) is the canonical place for
non-derivable knowledge — packaging traps, upstream quirks, design decisions
and their reasons. Append to it when you discover something; it is already
carrying several findings that cost real debugging time.

### Verification

```bash
pytest                        # 78 tests, ~2s
ruff check src tests          # lint
ruff format --check src tests # format
pre-commit run --all-files    # exactly what CI runs
```
