"""Stage a fit as a data-assembler ingest directory, for ISAAC export.

nr-workbench does not map anything to the ISAAC schema. That mapping lives in
``nr-isaac-format``, fed by ``data-assembler``, and reimplementing it here would
be a second copy to keep in step with a schema neither project owns.

What the assembler needs is a *file contract*, not a workflow: a directory
holding ``run_info.json``, the serialised bumps problem, its ``-err.json``
companion, and a ``final_state.json`` carrying chi-squared. Everything in that
contract is already in a fit record, so this module rewrites it into the shape
the assembler reads and lets the canonical pipeline do the rest.

Two things about that contract earn the module.

**Angle segments are one measurement, not three.** A REF_L steady state is
measured at three incident angles and reduced to three files with three run
numbers. They are one physical measurement of one sample, and the assembler
treats every file in a state's ``data_files`` as exactly that -- one ISAAC
record carrying N series. Listing them as separate states would claim three
measurements that never happened. (Getting this wrong is a bug AuRE has already
fixed once.)

**A co-refinement is several states of one sample.** Writing ``states[]``
rather than a flat file list gets each condition its own record, with the whole
co-refinement recorded as one fit spanning them, and the records cross-linked
by ``links[].same_sample_as`` because they share a sample id. That is what
makes three ISAAC records readable as three conditions of one experiment
rather than three unrelated measurements.

The grouping is never inferred from filenames. It comes from the frozen spec,
whose ``Measurement.key`` (``run218386#0``) is the same string the fit recorded
in its manifest -- so what is exported is what was fitted.
