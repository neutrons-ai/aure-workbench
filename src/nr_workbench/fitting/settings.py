"""How a fit is set up when the command line does not say.

A fitter setting comes from, in order:

1. the command line -- ``nrw fit run model.py --method de --steps 3000`` -- or
   what the Experiment page's Fit form was given;
2. the project's ``nrw.toml``: ``[fit]`` for the fitter and for what applies to
   every fitter (``seed``, ``parallel``), and one table per fitter for its own
   settings (``[fit.dream]``, ``[fit.de]``, ``[fit.amoeba]``);
3. bumps' own default for that fitter, and :data:`DEFAULT_METHOD` for the
   fitter itself.

A fitter's table applies to that fitter only. DREAM's ``samples`` never reaches
an amoeba fit: bumps would ignore it, but the fit record would still carry it,
and two identical amoeba fits would read as different runs.

Whatever a fit ran with is kept in its record, wherever each value came from,
so a fit stays reproducible after ``nrw.toml`` changes.

A fit started by an unattended session (``NRW_AGENT`` set) is also held to
``[agent.limits.<method>]``: the most it may ask of each of its fitter's own
settings, compared with what it would actually run with. See
:class:`AgentLimits`.

Nothing here imports bumps: this is read by ``nrw fit run --help`` and by the
page, neither of which may pay for it.
