"""Automatic checks on a finished fit, and the prose to go with them.

Two halves, deliberately separated by what they need.

The **computable** half runs everywhere, with no language model and no AuRE
import. It reads the bumps problem JSON, the ``.par`` file and the DREAM
``-err.json`` and reports what those say about whether the answer is trustable:
parameters pressed against their bounds, posteriors that span most of their
prior, a maximum-likelihood point sitting outside its own credible interval,
per-model chi-squared spread, and BIC against the sibling fits of the same
sample. None of that is a matter of opinion, and all of it is the kind of thing
that gets missed at 2am.

The **judgement** half calls AuRE's ``analyze_fit_quality_with_llm``, which asks
a model whether the numbers are physically sensible given ``sample.md`` and the
installed domain skills. It runs only when an endpoint is configured.

The split matters because AuRE's own no-LLM fallback (``_simple_evaluation``)
is three chi-squared bands and nothing else --- it reads no parameters, no
bounds, no posterior. Wrapping it would have made the offline path look
supported while telling a user less than they could work out themselves. So the
offline path here is nr-workbench's own, and it is the stronger of the two on
everything except physics.

A posterior-aware boundary check is worth calling out: AuRE tests the point
estimate against the bound, and a parameter whose *p95 edge* touches its floor
is pinned in a way that test cannot see. Both are reported, separately.
