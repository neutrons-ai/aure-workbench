"""``nrw fit star | unstar | discard | restore | delete`` -- a person's word on a fit.

The terminal's side of what the Fits page offers. The rules -- what may be
discarded, what must be discarded before its files go, what nothing may use
if they do -- are :mod:`nr_workbench.provenance.curation`'s, so the two cannot
disagree. Each refuses under ``NRW_AGENT``: which fits are good, set aside or
deleted is a person's judgement, as a promotion is.
