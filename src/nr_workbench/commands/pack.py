"""``nrw pack`` -- turn a fit into something a collaborator can run.

A result directory is complete but not portable. It records the *hashes* of the
data rather than the data, and its script reaches out to the project around it.
Send someone the directory and they get a perfect description of a fit they
cannot run.

A bundle closes that gap. It carries the frozen script, the actual measurement
files at the paths the script expects, the recorded settings, and enough of the
original outputs to check the answer against. The receiving end needs refl1d,
bumps and numpy --- no nr-workbench, no project, no network.

Three decisions shape the layout:

**The project structure is preserved rather than flattened.** The generated
script finds its root by walking up for ``nrw.toml`` and reads data as
``PROJECT_ROOT / "samples/<id>/data/..."``. Rebuilding that shape means the
script is copied byte-for-byte --- the same bytes whose sha256 is in the
manifest --- instead of rewritten. A bundle whose script had been edited to
suit the bundle would be a different script, and could not be checked against
the record it claims to reproduce.

**A fit whose inputs have drifted cannot be packed.** The point of the bundle
is that its data is the data that produced the result. If a file on disk no
longer matches its recorded hash, shipping it would quietly ship a different
experiment.

**It verifies itself.** ``verify.py`` recomputes chi-squared and compares it
with the recorded value, so the first thing the recipient learns is whether
their environment reproduces yours --- before they change anything.
