"""``nrw aure`` -- set up, run, and import a first fit from AuRE.

AuRE is good at the one thing nr-workbench cannot do for you: propose a layer
stack from a sentence and iterate it against the data until it fits. It is not
a provenance system, and this package's offline fit checks are better than its
own, so the division of labour is deliberate:

* ``nrw aure new`` writes the setup, filling in the facts from disk and the
  prose from ``sample.md``, and validates it through AuRE's own loader.
* ``nrw aure run`` runs it, in the foreground, on a budget, and records the
  environment-only knobs AuRE does not record for itself.
* ``nrw aure import`` turns the fitted model into an ordinary model spec, after
  which everything downstream -- ``generate``, ``fit run``, ``assess``,
  ``promote`` -- is the normal path with full provenance.

The last step is the point. An AuRE run is reconnaissance; the fit that counts
is the one ``nrw fit run`` records.
