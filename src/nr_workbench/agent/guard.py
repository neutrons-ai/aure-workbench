"""Refuse the commands an unattended agent must not run.

Two things an agent may not do without a person: publish a result as the answer
(``nrw promote``), and send it outside the project (``nrw isaac export
--upload``). A third is subtler and matters more --- any flag whose whole job
is to override a check that said no: ``--force`` everywhere it appears, and
``nrw init --nested``, which would otherwise let a project be scaffolded
inside another one with nothing to reconcile the two. Every one of these
exists because some check said no, and each either records that it was forced
or backs up what it displaced. An agent reaching for one has hit exactly the
situation a human is supposed to see.

This runs as a Claude Code ``PreToolUse`` hook, so the refusal happens before
the command executes and does not depend on the model agreeing. ``nrw`` itself
refuses the same set under ``NRW_AGENT=1``, which is a second mechanism rather
than a belt-and-braces flourish: a hook can be misconfigured and an
environment variable can be unset, but both failing silently at once is a
different order of accident.

The refusal always names what to do instead. An agent that is only told "no"
retries; one that is told "write it in ESCALATIONS.md and stop" has somewhere
to put the decision.
