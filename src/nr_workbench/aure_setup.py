"""Compose an AuRE setup document from a sample's files and its prose.

AuRE's "setup YAML" describes one analysis run. Building it here rather than
asking a model to write one keeps the same split ``nrw model new`` already
uses: **facts come from the files, judgement comes from the notes.** The run,
its segment files and their order are read from disk and are exact; the stack,
the ambient medium and the geometry are the scientist's to state, and are read
from ``sample.md``.

Three upstream rules shape the output, all from AuRE's ``docs/launching.md``
§U2 ("one state, several files"):

* A REF_L measurement is **one state with several files** -- the spliced Q
  segments of a single curve share one refl1d ``Sample``, so every layer
  parameter is tied across them automatically.
* **Combined and partial files may not be mixed in one state**, and partials
  must share one set id. The setup-YAML route enforces this; the ad-hoc
  ``aure analyze -d`` route skips the check and will accept a mix, which is
  why this module exists rather than a shell command.
* ``theta_offset`` and ``sample_broadening`` are **partials-only** upstream,
  so they are never emitted for a combined-file state.

Nothing here imports ``aure``. The document is a plain mapping; validating it
against the real loader is :func:`nr_workbench.aure_adapter.validate_setup`,
which is where the import lives.
