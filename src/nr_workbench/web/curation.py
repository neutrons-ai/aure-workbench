"""Curating fits from the Fits and fit pages: star, finalize, discard, delete.

The rules are :mod:`nr_workbench.provenance.curation`'s -- the same the
``nrw fit`` commands and ``nrw promote`` follow -- so the page and the terminal
cannot disagree about what may be set aside or deleted. This adds only what a
page needs: the write gate, a fit named exactly (never a prefix, which a later
fit could come to match), and a confirmation that names the fit before its
files go.

Nothing here imports Flask; :mod:`nr_workbench.web.experiment_api` maps the
errors to status codes.
