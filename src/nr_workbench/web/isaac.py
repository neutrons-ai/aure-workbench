"""Publishing a finalized fit to ISAAC from its page: export, validate, push.

Each step is the command a person would type, run as a job
(:mod:`nr_workbench.web.jobs`): ``nrw isaac export``, then ``nrw isaac push
--validate-only``, then ``nrw isaac push``. Push sends the records the export
wrote, unchanged, so what the server validated is what is published. The rules
are the commands' own -- only the final fit of a sample is published, and each
push is recorded in the fit index -- and the page asks only for the final fit.

The key never passes through here. ``nrw isaac push`` reads ``ISAAC_URL`` and
``ISAAC_KEY`` as every setting is read -- in ``~/.nrw``, say -- and this says
only where each is set, and the portal's host.

Nothing here imports Flask; :mod:`nr_workbench.web.experiment_api` maps the
errors to status codes.
