"""nrw commands run for the Experiment page: one at a time, as child processes.

A fit takes minutes to hours of CPU, so it runs neither in the request nor in
the server's process: nothing could stop it there, and a crash in bumps would
take the page down with it. A job is a short list of ``nrw`` commands --
``model generate``, then ``fit run`` -- run one after another in the project,
each in a process group of its own, so that Cancel stops every process a step
started, bumps' parallel workers included.

One at a time: two fits compete for the same cores, and neither finishes sooner
than if it had waited its turn. What a job printed is kept in
``.nrw/jobs/<id>.log`` and what it was in ``<id>.json``, so the page can say
what became of a job after ``nrw serve`` was restarted under it. The folder
ignores itself in git, keeps the newest :data:`KEEP_JOBS` jobs, and is never
read or written through a symbolic link: the log is served to the page, and a
link planted in a shared project would serve whatever it pointed at.

Cancel sends SIGTERM, never SIGINT: bumps' DREAM takes a keyboard interrupt as
"stop sampling" and returns the chain so far, which ``nrw fit run`` would then
record as a finished fit.
