"""A sample's models, for the Experiment page: its specs, a new one, and fits.

A spec is written by ``nrw model new --from-notes``, and a fit runs ``nrw
model generate`` and ``nrw fit run`` -- the commands a person types, run as
jobs, in child processes in the project (:mod:`nr_workbench.web.jobs`), so the
page and the terminal cannot disagree about what a spec holds or how a fit is
recorded. The model code is
never imported into the server, which would load it, and whatever it imports,
into the process serving every page.

Which commands make up a fit is decided here, with the request they answer.

Nothing here imports Flask; :mod:`nr_workbench.web.experiment_api` maps the
errors to status codes.
