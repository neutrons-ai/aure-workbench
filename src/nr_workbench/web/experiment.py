"""Everything the Experiment page knows, with no Flask anywhere.

The same split as :mod:`nr_workbench.web.project`: this class is testable with
nothing but a directory, and :mod:`nr_workbench.web.experiment_api` mirrors it
one-to-one, so an agent can ``curl`` exactly what the page renders.

Two rules shape it:

**No request waits on the data mount.** Listing the source is the background
poller's job (:class:`~nr_workbench.experiment.live.LiveInventory`); requests
read its last snapshot. The two things that must read the source -- a quick
look at a run's curves, and the fresh look apply takes before writing -- run
under a deadline with a cap on how many may wait at once
(:class:`~nr_workbench.bounded.Bounded`), so a dead mount costs those requests
a timeout rather than a thread each, forever.

**Writes are the catalog's and apply's.** This class decides nothing: the
catalog validates edits, apply decides what may be copied. It refuses every
write when the server was started read-only, which the request gate in
:mod:`nr_workbench.web.security` also enforces -- two mechanisms, as with the
agent guard, so that forgetting one is not a hole.
