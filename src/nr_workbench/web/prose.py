"""Rendering ``sample.md`` for the right rail.

``sample.md`` is the human record, and the scaffolded template puts its worked
examples inside HTML comments so they guide the author without appearing in the
file's own output. Those comments are stripped here for the same reason
:func:`nr_workbench.project.scan._runs_mentioned` strips them: the commented
example lists run numbers and conditions that were never measured, and showing
them beside the real data would be actively misleading.

Raw HTML is not rendered. A ``sample.md`` is usually written by the person
reading it, but it also travels -- copied between beamtimes, pasted from a
colleague, committed by a collaborator -- and there is no reason for prose in a
side panel to be able to run script.
