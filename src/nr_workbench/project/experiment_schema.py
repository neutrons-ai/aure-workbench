"""What can be set about an experiment, and how nrw writes it into ``nrw.toml``.

The one registry of the experiment's settings -- which keys exist, their
defaults and ranges, the source and watcher choices that exist and those
still coming -- and the one renderer of the experiment tables, which the
scaffold template and the ``nrw.toml`` writer share, so ``nrw init`` renders
back exactly what a save wrote.

It imports nothing from the modules that use it (the renderer, the writer,
the experiment package), so any of them can import it at load time.
