"""The project's ``.env``: the lines nrw's pages write, and nothing else.

``.env`` is the person's file. It may hold keys, comments and settings for
other tools, so nrw changes only the lines that set the variables it was asked
to, and leaves every other byte as it was. It is edited through python-dotenv's
own parser -- the reader every nrw command uses -- so what nrw changes is what
a reader sees change, a quoted value spanning lines included.

In a shared project another account could plant a link at ``.env``, so the file
is read through a descriptor opened without following one, and replaced whole
(:func:`nr_workbench.fsutil.atomic_write_bytes`) with the mode that descriptor
reported: it is never looked up by name after the check. A new one is readable
by its owner only, because it is where keys go.

A change is made against the revision of the file the page was shown, and
checked again just before the file is replaced, so an edit made by hand in
between is refused rather than written over. The revision is keyed per
process: it is served to anyone who can read the page, and a plain hash of a
file of secrets would confirm a guess of its contents.
