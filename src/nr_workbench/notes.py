"""The analysis notebook: prose tied to the fits it is about.

Two homes, because there are two kinds of note and they have different
lifetimes:

``samples/<id>/results/<fit_id>/NOTES.md``
    What *this run* was for and what it showed. It lives inside the immutable
    result directory --- the one file there that may be edited --- so it cannot
    drift away from the numbers it describes, and it travels in a bundle.

``samples/<id>/reports/*.md``
    How the fits relate: the argument, the rejected models, the conclusion.
    This is sample-scoped rather than project-scoped because that is the level
    the thinking actually happens at, and it is the level a collaborator
    receives.

Both are ordinary markdown. That is deliberate. The evidence from a real
beamtime is a 609-line file of dated findings that a scientist wrote fluently
and a set of 25 structured note stubs that nobody filled in once --- prose was
never the problem. What was missing was that nothing could *find* the prose:
one entry opens "Read this before using that fit for anything" about a named
fit, in a file that ``nrw promote`` and ``nrw pack`` never open.

So the only structure imposed here is the link. A note is attached to a fit by
naming its id --- in optional frontmatter, or simply anywhere in the text,
which is how people already write. :func:`fits_mentioned` finds both, so an
existing findings file becomes a linked notebook by being moved, with no
edits.
