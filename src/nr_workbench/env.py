"""Loading configuration from ``.env``, the way AuRE does.

Settings -- currently the language-model endpoint -- come from environment
variables. Those can be supplied four ways, in decreasing precedence:

1. the real shell environment, which is never overridden;
2. a project-local ``.env``, found by walking up from the working directory;
3. a per-user ``~/.nrw``, in the same ``KEY=value`` format;
4. a per-user ``~/.aure``, so a machine already configured for AuRE works here
   without duplicating the key.

The fourth is a convenience, and it is reported by ``nrw doctor`` rather than
being silent: configuration arriving from a file you did not think you were
using is exactly the kind of thing that makes "it works on my machine" hard to
debug.

**Loaded lazily.** ``python-dotenv`` costs about 40 ms to import, and
``nrw --help`` must stay instant, so nothing here runs until something actually
needs a setting.
