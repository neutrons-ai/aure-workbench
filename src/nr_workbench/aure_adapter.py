"""The only module in this package that imports AuRE.

Two constraints shape everything here.

**Every import is function-local.** ``import aure`` costs 1.5-3 seconds and
pulls the whole LLM stack: ``aure/__init__.py`` eagerly imports ``.state`` and
``.workflow``, which chain through eight node modules into ``langchain_core``
and ``periodictable``. ``nrw --help`` must never pay that, and
``tests/test_cli.py`` fails if it does. A module-scope ``import aure`` anywhere
in this package is a bug.

**AuRE declares no stable API.** Its ``__all__`` covers only
``ReflectivityState``, ``create_initial_state`` and ``run_analysis``; every
function used below appears in no ``__all__`` anywhere, and the project has
already been through one architectural rewrite. Routing all of it through one
module means an upstream signature change is a one-file fix rather than a
scavenger hunt, and :func:`contract` lets a test assert the signatures we
depend on before a fit does it for us.

What is deliberately *not* wrapped: ``parse_ort_file`` is a stub that reads
column data and ignores the ORSO header, not an ORSO reader. Use
:func:`load_data` on the reduced ASCII we actually have.
