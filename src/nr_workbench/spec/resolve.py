"""Turn a spec into a parameter table: which object every slot points at.

This is where the aliasing pitfall is eliminated. ``corefine-model/SKILL.md``
documents the trap: once angle segments 1..N alias segment 0's Parameter
object, later *reassigning* segment 0's parameter does not propagate, and the
cross-dataset constraint silently fails. It has produced wrong results.

The fix is structural rather than procedural. Resolution answers, for every
``(group, measurement, path)`` slot, *which key it reads from* -- and the
generated code then assigns from that table in three passes:

1. create every free parameter, once, from the table;
2. build every constrained expression from those free parameters;
3. assign every slot from the table.

No assignment ever reads from another Experiment, so there is no "segment 0" to
go stale. Segment 0 is not the source of truth; the table is.

This module is pure: no refl1d, no bumps, no filesystem beyond the discovery
helpers. That makes the hard part testable on its own.
