// Refuse the commands an unattended agent must not run.
//
// Written by `nrw init`. This is OpenCode's half of a limit that Claude Code
// gets from a PreToolUse hook: `tool.execute.before` runs before the command
// does, so the refusal does not depend on the model agreeing to it.
//
// **No refusal logic lives here.** Every decision is `nrw agent guard`, which
// splits the raw command line on `;&|()` and newlines before tokenising and
// scans every segment -- six real shapes got past an earlier version that
// looked only at the first few tokens (`if true; then nrw promote...`,
// `A=1 nrw promote abc`, `python -m nr_workbench.cli promote abc`, ...).
// Reimplementing any part of that in JavaScript would mean two answers to the
// same question, and the one here would be the stale one.
//
// The deny list in opencode.json is the second, weaker mechanism: it matches
// the command as written, so `A=1 nrw promote x` slips past it. `nrw` itself
// refuses the same actions from the inside when NRW_AGENT=1, which is the
// third. A hook can be misconfigured and an environment variable can be unset;
// all three failing silently at once is a different order of accident.
//
// Note `opencode --pure` skips external plugins, and therefore this file.
