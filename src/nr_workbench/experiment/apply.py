"""Apply: project the catalog into ``samples/<id>/``, where the workflow reads it.

Nothing downstream knows the catalog exists. ``nrw model new``, ``nrw data
reconcile``, ``nrw agent watch`` and the rest read ``samples/<id>/data/`` and
``sample.md`` exactly as before; apply is the one step that writes them from
what the experimenter decided. It is explicit -- planned, shown, then done --
because it writes into a directory people and agents are working in.

The rules, each of which exists because the obvious version fails quietly:

**Only complete runs are copied.** A run that has merely stopped changing may
be a third of a measurement (see :mod:`~nr_workbench.experiment.status`). An
*unconfirmed* run is copied only when a person confirms it; a quarantined,
arriving or clock-skewed one never.

**A run is copied whole or not at all.** Its files are staged under names no
reader looks for, checked, and only then renamed into ``data/steady`` in one
burst. They get a fresh modification time, not the source's: a copy dated
hours ago would look settled to ``nrw agent watch`` the moment it landed.

**Nothing is overwritten.** ``data/sources.json`` records the digest of every
file nrw copied, so a later apply can tell "the facility re-reduced it" from
"someone edited the copy" from "someone else put a different file here" -- and
reports all three rather than choosing.

**Exclusion is real.** A copied run that is now excluded, or assigned to
another sample, is *moved* to ``data/excluded/<run>/``: reversibly, and out of
every reader's way, rather than left for each one to remember a flag. Files
nrw did not copy are reported and never moved.

**sample.md goes through the scaffold's three-way rule.** A hand-edited one is
kept and the catalog's version is written beside it as ``sample.md.nrw-new``.
