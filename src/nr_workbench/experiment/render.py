"""Planning a sample's files -- from the catalog when the catalog manages it.

:func:`plan_sample` is the **only** way this package plans a sample's files, and
``nrw sample new`` and ``nrw init --sample`` go through it too. That is the
point of it. Three callers used to render the blank template, and any one of
them run after the catalog had written ``sample.md`` would have reset it:
the lock records the catalog's content as "what nrw installed", so an
untouched file reads as due for a template upgrade. The scaffold's ``owner``
rule now refuses that structurally; this makes the three callers not ask.

Nothing here writes. It plans, and the scaffold's three-way rule decides what
may be written -- so a ``sample.md`` edited by hand is never overwritten, only
joined by a ``sample.md.nrw-new``.
