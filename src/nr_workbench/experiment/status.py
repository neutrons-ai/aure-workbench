"""When is a run finished arriving?

*Settled* -- no file has changed for a while -- is necessary and not enough.
The segments of one run are reduced as each angle finishes being measured: in
the reference corpus, 218386's three segments landed 15 and then 52 minutes
apart. A five-minute settle therefore calls the run complete twice before it
is, and a copy made then is a third of a measurement that fits perfectly well.

So *complete* needs evidence that the sequence has ended, and today there is
one kind that proves it: **the instrument moved on** -- a *later run whose
files have been reduced*. A later run that a feed merely *announces* does not
count: that is when the next acquisition started, and this run's last segment
may still be reducing.

**The header's plan can veto, but not prove.** The ``new_reduction`` header's
per-segment arrays appear to be sized by the reduction template, so they
would say how many segments there will be (:attr:`~nr_workbench.instrument.
header.ReducedHeader.n_segments`). When they say three and two are present,
the run is not complete, whatever else is true. But whether those arrays are
already full length in the *first* segment's file has not been checked on a
real file: if they grow as segments are reduced instead, a count read from
segment 1 is 1, and trusting it would copy a third of a measurement five
minutes after it landed. Until a real first-segment file settles that, a
fulfilled plan still waits for a later run (or a person) -- see
``docs/ground_truths.md``.

A settled run without that evidence is *unconfirmed*. It is shown, it can be
assigned, and a person can confirm it -- but it is never copied on its own.
