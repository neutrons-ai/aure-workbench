"""Bring a hand-written sample.md into the catalog -- or pull hand edits back into it.

Two situations, one mechanism:

**Adopting** a sample that predates the catalog. Its ``sample.md`` was written
in an editor; the catalog knows nothing about it. Its sections become the
sample's context and its measurement table becomes run assignments.

**Pulling** hand edits. The catalog renders a sample's ``sample.md``; someone
edits the file by hand; the scaffold then refuses to overwrite it and writes
the catalog's version beside it. Pulling reads the edited file back into the
catalog, so the two agree again.

Either way the file is *parsed*, never guessed at, and anything the parser
cannot carry into the catalog is listed as a **leftover** rather than dropped.
A leftover blocks the rewrite: the rewrite replaces the file with the catalog's
rendering, and text with no place in the catalog would be lost in it. (The
original is backed up regardless, under ``.nrw/backups/``; note that that
directory is gitignored, so the backup exists on this machine only.)
