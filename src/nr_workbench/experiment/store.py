"""Where the catalog is kept: two parquet tables and a manifest, in ``experiment/``.

``runs.parquet`` holds one row per run and ``samples.parquet`` one row per
sample -- the split data-assembler's lakehouse uses, where a measurement row
carries a nullable sample id and samples are their own table. ``catalog.json``
records the sha256 of both, is written *last* on every save, and is how an
interrupted save is told apart from a complete one.

Four failure modes decide how this is written, each of them silent if handled
the obvious way:

**A file that exists but will not parse is not an empty catalog.** It raises
:class:`CatalogCorruptError`, which is deliberately *not* a ``ValueError``:
pyarrow's ``ArrowInvalid`` is one, and the house pattern ``except (OSError,
ValueError)`` would turn a damaged catalog into an empty one -- whose next save
would then replace every decision the experimenter made with nothing.

**A binary merge conflict has no conflict markers.** Git leaves "ours" in the
working tree, which loads perfectly. Load and save are refused while git
reports ``experiment/`` unmerged.

**Two writers.** A browser tab and a terminal can edit at once. Every update is
a read-modify-write under a lock, and checks each edited record's revision, so
a concurrent edit to a *different* record is merged and one to the *same*
record is refused.

**An interrupted save.** The two tables are replaced one after the other; a
crash between them leaves a pair that parses. The manifest catches that, and
the previous complete pair is kept under ``.nrw/cache/experiment/`` to recover
from.

pyarrow is imported inside the functions that use it: it costs about a second,
and ``nrw --help`` must stay instant.
