Pure data: no pyarrow, no filesystem, no web framework. Everything a person can
type into the experiment page is checked here, once, before it can reach a
parquet file or a ``sample.md`` -- because ``sample.md`` is read by about
twenty modules that each parse it their own way, and text that one of them
misreads is a wrong fit rather than an error:

* A heading line inside a description (``## Fits to perform``) starts a new
  section for every reader that splits on headings -- including the one that
  hands an unattended agent its task.
* ``<!--`` swallows everything up to the template's next ``-->`` for every
  reader that strips comments before looking for sections.
* A ``|`` in a table cell, or a line separator Python's ``splitlines`` honours,
  shifts or drops a row of the measurement table that ISAAC export and
  ``nrw data reconcile`` read conditions from.

So those are rejected with the reason, never silently rewritten: a person
whose text was changed behind their back cannot tell what the file now says.
