"""The data source for a machine with the data mount: one folder, polled.

Polling, not filesystem events: the folder is on NFS, where inotify is a
suggestion, and the reduction takes minutes anyway -- the same reasoning, and
the same conclusion, as ``nrw agent watch``.

Three things this is careful about, because the folder is shared:

* **One listing per poll.** Every file's size and times come from that single
  ``scandir``; nothing is stat'ed twice, and headers are re-read only when a
  file's identity changes.
* **Nothing is followed.** A symbolic link in a team-writable folder, named like
  a reduced file, could point anywhere the scientist can read; copying it would
  put that file into their repository. Links are reported and skipped, and
  files are opened with ``O_NOFOLLOW``.
* **Only canonical names count.** A name the reduction would not have written
  exactly is reported, not used -- see
  :func:`nr_workbench.instrument.reduced.canonical_name`.
