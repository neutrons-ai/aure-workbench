"""Where the experiment's reduced data comes from.

A :class:`DataSource` answers two questions and no others: *what files exist*
(:meth:`~DataSource.inventory`) and *what bytes does this file hold*
(:meth:`~DataSource.read_bytes`). Everything else -- when a run counts as
complete, whether it may be copied, how a copy is made safely -- is decided
once, outside, so that every source is held to the same rules.

Only the local folder exists today. A Tiled source implements the same three
methods; see ``docs/experiment-sources.md``. It has to hand back the *original*
bytes under the *original* name: the header carries the angle in radians and
the dQ convention, and the ``new_reduction`` dialect records the segment number
only in the filename.
