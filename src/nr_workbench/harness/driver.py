"""How each harness is started unattended, and how its output is read.

One harness per backend, three things each: the command line that starts a
headless session, whether this project has installed the limit that harness
needs, and how to turn its event stream into a progress line.

The two backends differ in a way that matters and is not cosmetic:

* **Claude Code** takes a turn cap (``--max-turns``) and, run with
  ``--permission-mode bypassPermissions``, keeps only its hooks --- the deny
  list in ``settings.json`` stops applying. Two mechanisms: the hook, and
  ``NRW_AGENT=1``.
* **OpenCode** has *no turn cap at all*, so a bounded session there means a
  wall-clock timeout and nothing else. But ``--auto`` auto-approves only what
  is not explicitly denied, so its deny list survives --- three mechanisms:
  the plugin, the deny list, and ``NRW_AGENT=1``.

Both facts were measured against opencode 1.18.18, not read off a docs page;
see docs/ground_truths.md.
