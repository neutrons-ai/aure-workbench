    """One coding assistant a project can be scaffolded for.

    Most fields are optional because most harnesses do not do every job. A
    ``None`` means "this assistant has no such thing", not "not filled in yet":
    Copilot genuinely has no settings file to write ``NRW_BIN`` into, and
    inventing a path for it would produce a file nothing reads.

    Attributes:
        name: Registry key, used in ``nrw.toml`` and ``--harness``.
        title: Human-readable name, for reports a scientist reads.
        template_subdir: Subdirectory of ``templates/harness/`` holding this
            harness's scaffold files, or None if it has none of its own.
        agents_dir: Where thin dispatcher stubs go, relative to the project
            root, or None if the harness does not read subagent files.
        dispatcher_frontmatter: Extra YAML frontmatter lines for this harness's
            dispatchers. Claude Code understands a ``tools:`` guardrail;
            Copilot's schema rejects those names, so it gets none.
        local_settings: Machine-local settings file that can carry ``NRW_BIN``,
            relative to the project root, or None.
        vscode_extension: Marketplace id to recommend in
            ``.vscode/extensions.json``, or None.
        drives_sessions: Whether ``nrw agent run`` can drive this harness
            unattended.
        binary: The executable that starts it, when it drives sessions.
        build_argv: Builds the headless command line. See
            :func:`nr_workbench.harness.driver.claude_argv`.
        verify_guard: Raises :class:`~nr_workbench.harness.driver.GuardMissing`
            if this project has not installed the limit this harness needs.
        read_event: Turns one decoded output event into ``(tool, target)``, or
            None for events it does not recognise.
        read_outcome: Turns a finished run's stdout into what it answered, for
            `nrw check-llm`.
