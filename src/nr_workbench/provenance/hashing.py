"""Content hashing for provenance records.

Every input a fit consumed is hashed, so a result can later be checked against
what is on disk: if a data file was re-reduced, the fit that used the old bytes
is stale and must say so.

Hashing a 200-slice tNR series on every command would be slow, so digests are
memoized in ``.nrw/cache/hashes.json`` keyed by ``(size, mtime_ns)``. That is a
cache, never a source of truth -- ``--verify`` style checks bypass it.
