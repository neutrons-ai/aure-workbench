"""Turn a fit id --- or a prefix of one --- into its entry and directory.

Every command that takes a fit id on the command line needs the same three
steps: resolve the prefix, insist it is unambiguous, and find the directory the
run wrote. Keeping them here means one message for "no such fit" and one for
"that prefix matches four of them", rather than a slightly different pair per
command.
