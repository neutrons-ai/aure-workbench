"""Which fits a person stars, finalizes, sets aside, deletes or publishes.

Curation is recorded the way a promotion always has been: appended to
``.nrw/index.jsonl`` and never rewritten, with who and when. It merges in git,
and a fit's history -- the bad ones included -- stays readable.

**One reader.** :func:`replay` is the only code that reads these events: what
a fit is now is the last word on it -- starred until unstarred, discarded until
restored -- and a label is held by the last fit of its sample promoted to it,
a fit with no sample in a slot of its own. Everything that asks "is this fit
final" asks the replay, because every reader that worked it out for itself got
it wrong for a project with more than one sample.

**Discard, then delete.** Discarding hides a fit from the listings and keeps
every file, with a reason. Deleting frees the disk: a second, explicit step,
only for a fit already discarded, and only when nothing uses it -- see
:func:`used_by`. The index keeps the record that it ran.

**The answer is never discarded.** The fit that is ``final`` for its sample is
not set aside; finalize another first. A discarded fit is not finalized or
starred until it is restored.

**A push is recorded before it runs.** Its attempt -- the files it sends, and
their digests -- is appended first, and its outcome after: a push cancelled or
killed half way has still made records a portal keeps, and the index says it
may have.

These are a person's decisions: each refuses under ``NRW_AGENT``, as the
commands and the read-only web server do. Nothing here imports click; the
commands and the page wrap it.
