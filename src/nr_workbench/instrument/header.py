"""Reading the metadata REF_L writes into a reduced file's header.

Every reduced steady-state file carries a full record of how it was made, in a
single JSON object on a ``# Meta:`` line:

    # Meta:{"theta": 0.007853609528660925, "norm_run": 218274,
            "dq_over_q": 0.0271, "scaling_factors": {"a": 4.0, ...}, ...}

That is exact, machine-readable, and already on disk. Guessing any of it is
therefore not a heuristic problem -- it is a parsing problem that was being
skipped.

**Angles are stored in radians.** ``theta: 0.00785`` is 0.45 degrees. Reading
it as degrees is the kind of error that produces a fit rather than a failure.

**Why this is not an LLM call.** ``theta`` sets the resolution of every point
through ``dT = dq/q * tan(theta)``, so a plausible-looking wrong value corrupts
a fit silently. A parser is exact, deterministic, offline, and testable; a
model call is none of those, and would be asked to read a number that is
already sitting in a JSON field. Where a model genuinely helps is an *unfamiliar*
header, and the right shape for that is: parse the format we know, fail loudly
when we meet one we do not, and document the format so an agent can read a new
one itself -- see the ``refl-reduced-headers`` skill.

Time-resolved slices carry no header at all. Nothing invents one; the caller is
told the angle is unknown and must declare it.

**Two dialects are live.** ``_partial.txt`` writes the ``# Meta:`` block above;
``_autoreduction.dat`` writes ``# Key = value`` lines and, crucially, a fourth
column in **sigma** rather than FWHM. Which one a file is in is decided here,
and the filename patterns that decide it are also duplicated in
``project/scan.py`` and in AuRE -- see ``docs/plan-reduced-format-registry.md``.

    """What a reduced REF_L file records about its own making.

    Attributes:
        path: The file this came from.
        theta: Incident angle in **degrees**, converted from the radians the
            file stores. ``None`` when the file carries no header.
        run: The run that produced this segment.
        norm_run: The direct-beam run it was divided by. ``None`` in the
            ``new_reduction`` dialect, which records a filename instead -- see
            ``norm_source``.
        norm_source: The direct beam as named by the ``new_reduction`` header,
            e.g. ``"A2_Si.txt"``. A filename rather than a run number, so it
            does not say *when* that direct beam was measured -- which is the
            question a disagreeing pair of segments sends you here to answer.
        sequence_number: Which angle segment this is, 1-based.
        sequence_id: The run number of the measurement as a whole.
        n_segments: How many angle segments the measurement was *planned*
            with, where the header says. Only the ``new_reduction`` dialect
            does: its per-segment arrays (``DB``, ``scale_factor``,
            ``ThetaShift``) come from the reduction template, so they are
            sized to the plan rather than to what has been reduced so far.
            ``None`` when the header does not say, or when those arrays
            disagree about the count -- a guess here would call a run
            complete while its last segment is still being measured.
        dq_over_q: Fractional resolution as reduced.
        dq_convention: ``"fwhm"`` or ``"sigma"`` -- what the 4th column's width
            actually is, read from the column-title line. ``None`` when the file
            does not say, which is normal for a time-resolved slice and means
            the caller must declare it rather than assume.
        dq_column_label: The label exactly as written, for the error message
            when it is one we do not recognise.
        scaling_factor: The constant the reduction multiplied this segment by.
        q_range: ``(q_min, q_max)`` as recorded.
        wavelength_range: ``(wl_min, wl_max)`` in angstroms.
        run_title: The operator's title for the run.
        start_time: ISO-8601 start, usable for a geometry lookup.
        experiment: The IPTS identifier.
        theta_offset: Any offset already applied by the reduction.
        source: ``meta`` when read from the ``# Meta:`` JSON block,
            ``autoreduction`` from the ``new_reduction`` dialect, ``table``
            from the fixed-width summary, ``none`` when there was no header.
        raw: The full JSON object, for anything not surfaced above.
        warnings: What the header says that is self-contradictory. Empty on
            every healthy file, so a caller may surface these unconditionally.
            These are not read errors -- a malformed header raises -- but
            statements the file makes that disagree with each other, which are
            survivable and must not be survived quietly.
