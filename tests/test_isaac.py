"""Staging a fit for ISAAC export.

The schema mapping belongs to `nr-isaac-format` and is not retested here. What
is tested is the contract nr-workbench hands it, where two things have to be
right or the published record misstates the experiment:

* a state's angle segments are one measurement, not several; and
* co-refined states are conditions of one sample, not unrelated samples.
