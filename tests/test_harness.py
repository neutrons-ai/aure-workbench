"""Tests for the harness registry.

The registry is what stops `.claude/` and `.github/` being spelled out in six
modules. Its job is small and its failure mode is quiet -- a harness that
resolves to the wrong directory writes files nothing reads -- so the contract
is pinned here rather than inferred from the scaffold tests.
