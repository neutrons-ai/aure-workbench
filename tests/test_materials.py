"""Contrast-match arithmetic, and the substrates prompts may need an SLD for.

What used to be here was a name-to-density table with an `sld()` wrapper over
`periodictable`. It is gone. AuRE retired its equivalent because the SLDs in a
fitted model come from its intake LLM rather than a table, and the same applies
here with one more reason on top: the models this repository is used with supply
a compound density on request, and `periodictable` does the physics. The table
in between drifted -- six SLDs quoted in the skills had diverged from it, two of
them disagreeing with the table sitting beside them in the package.

`tests/test_skill_slds.py` is what replaced it: the numbers the skills quote are
checked against the physics directly, which is where the error actually was.
