"""Curating fits: star, finalize, discard, restore, and delete their files.

Fits here are recorded the way `nrw fit run` records them -- an index entry and
a result directory holding a manifest and its inputs -- without fitting
anything: what is under test is what a person may say about a fit, and what
that may and may not do to it. The rules are one module's; the terminal and the
page are each tested for reaching them, and for nothing else.
